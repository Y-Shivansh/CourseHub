What is React Context?
    -  Context is a way to pass data globally, without having to manually pass props through every level of the component tree.
    - Problem it solves: Prop Drilling
    - Without Context:
        <App>
        <Parent>
            <Child>
            <GrandChild theme="dark" /> // ❌ manually passing props down
            </Child>
        </Parent>
        </App>
        Even if only GrandChild needs the theme — every parent must pass it manually 😓

    - With Context:
        <ThemeProvider>
            <App />
        </ThemeProvider>
        No need to pass props anymore — just "subscribe" to the context anywhere.
